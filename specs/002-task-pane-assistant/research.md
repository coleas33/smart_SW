# Research: Task Pane Assistant

**Feature**: `002-task-pane-assistant` | **Date**: 2026-09-13 | **Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md)

Phase 0 output. Research was performed by three Opus subagents (SwpilotCLI mechanism; Codex
and Gemini CLI embedding, MCP, and restriction; OpenAI and Gemini SDK tool calling) plus
probes of the development machine. All web sources are as of 2026-09-13; none carried a
version stamp.

## R1. What SwpilotCLI's Task Pane actually is

**Finding**: At commit `5824b367` the Task Pane is a WinForms `UserControl` shown through
`CreateTaskpaneView3` and `DisplayWindowFromHandlex64`. For the plain shell it hosts
WebView2 with xterm.js over a ConPTY pseudo-console (`CreatePseudoConsole`, bytes to the
page as base64, keystrokes back through `postMessage`). For `claude` and `codex` it spawns
a real console window and reparents it with `SetParent`, a hack that races on `FindWindow`
and needs `taskkill /T /F` on shutdown. The add-in exposes no tools; the CLI runs 36
`net8.0-windows` console EXEs through Bash, each re-attaching to SOLIDWORKS through the
running object table. There is no chat transcript widget, no API call, no approval gate,
and the README recommends disabling the CLI's sandbox.

**Decision**: Reimplement the ConPTY plus xterm.js mechanism (Microsoft's MiniTerm sample
and xterm.js are MIT) and run the CLI through the pseudo-console instead of reparenting a
window. Copy no files: the SwpilotCLI license permits internal use but forbids
redistribution and derivative shipping.

## R2. Two runtimes in one pane

**Decision**: The Review tab is our own WebView2 chat page fed by the Python runner; the
Terminal tab embeds the engineer's Codex or Gemini CLI. Review needs curated tools, step
recording, findings, and dispositions, which a terminal cannot render; general chat wants
the CLI's own features and sign-in, which we should not rebuild.

**Alternatives considered**: terminal only (findings as text; no cards, no dispositions);
chat panel only driving general chat through the API (loses CLI sign-in, browsing, files);
driving the CLIs in JSON mode from the chat panel for review (`codex exec --json`,
`gemini -p -o stream-json`; rejected because curation would depend on per-seat CLI config
and the system prompt is replaced wholesale, though it remains a viable later backend).

## R3. Provider layer for the review loop

**Decision**: `AgentProvider` protocol with `run(system, messages, tools, effort, max_steps,
on_event)`; adapters `OpenAIProvider` and `GeminiProvider`; `FakeProvider` for tests. Tool
schemas come from `pydantic.TypeAdapter(fn).json_schema()` merged with a Google-style
docstring parser for parameter descriptions, so the tool modules keep their current shape.
`RecordedTool.call` returns `(payload, is_error)` and each adapter encodes it.

**OpenAI** (Responses API, `openai` SDK): tools are flat `{type: "function", name,
description, parameters, strict: true}`; strict requires `additionalProperties: false` on
every object, every property in `required`, optional as `["T", "null"]`. Loop keeps the
full `input` list and appends `response.output` verbatim (reasoning items must be echoed
back with tool outputs), then `function_call_output` items with `call_id`. Prompt goes in
`instructions`. Effort in `reasoning={"effort": ...}` (levels vary by model). Streaming
events `response.output_text.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.delta`,
`response.output_item.done`, `response.completed`. No auto-run helper in `openai-python`;
the Agents SDK is pre-1.0 and not used. Errors: `AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitError`,
`APIStatusError`, `APIConnectionError`, `APITimeoutError`.

**Gemini** (`google-genai`): `types.FunctionDeclaration(parameters_json_schema=...)` accepts
standard JSON Schema (strip `additionalProperties` and `$defs`); `automatic_function_calling
=AutomaticFunctionCallingConfig(disable=True)` is mandatory so our recording loop owns each
call; function responses are `Part.from_function_response` in a `role="tool"` content and
must carry the call `id` on 3.5+ models; thinking through `thinking_config.thinking_level`
(2.5 models use `thinking_budget`); `system_instruction` in the config; streaming via
`generate_content_stream` with events synthesized by the adapter. The newer
`client.interactions` API mirrors the Responses shape and is kept as a possible second
adapter. Errors: `google.genai.errors.ClientError`, `ServerError`, `APIError`.

**Auth**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL`; `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
(`GOOGLE_API_KEY` wins if both set); Gemini enterprise via `genai.Client(enterprise=True,
project=..., location=...)` with `vertexai=True` as the legacy alias. Settings from the pane
take precedence over environment variables and the source is reported.

**Models**: defaults `gpt-5.6` and `gemini-3.5-flash`, verified against each provider's
model list at settings time; the research listed `gemini-3.8-flash` through `gemini-2.5`
and OpenAI reference examples on `gpt-5.6` and `gpt-5.5`.

## R4. Restricting the CLIs for general chat

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`, profile selected with `--profile`): `sandbox_mode =
"read-only"`, `approval_policy = "never"`, `web_search = "disabled"`,
`[features] shell_tool = true` (read-only shell allowed for reading the run folder),
`[mcp_servers.swreview] command/args`, `enabled_tools` allowlist, `startup_timeout_sec`,
`tool_timeout_sec`. `apply_patch` has no documented off switch; the read-only sandbox
blocks its writes. Project-scoped `.codex/config.toml` loads only for trusted projects.
Tools are exposed as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (unverified in docs; from issue reports).
Windows sandbox is native (`[windows] sandbox = "elevated" | "unelevated"`); the development
machine's config currently routes Codex through WSL, which the generated profile must
override for the pane.

**Gemini** (`~/.gemini/settings.json` and `~/.gemini/policies/*.toml`): `mcpServers.swreview`
with `command`, `args`, `cwd`, `env`, `timeout` (default 600000 ms), `includeTools`; tools
are named `mcp_{server}_{tool}` truncated at 63 characters, so the server name must not
contain underscores. Policy engine: a deny-all rule at low priority plus an allow rule for
`mcpName = "swreview"` at high priority; run in `--approval-mode plan`. The semantics of
`tools.core: []` are unverified, so the policy rule is the enforced half.

**Claude Code** is documented for completeness only (`--disallowedTools`,
`--append-system-prompt`, `-p --output-format stream-json`) and is not used.

## R5. Terminal embedding

**Decision**: ConPTY pseudo-console (`CreatePseudoConsole`, `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE`)
hosted by the add-in, output forwarded to xterm.js in WebView2 as base64 chunks, input and
resize sent back through `postMessage`. Both CLIs are ordinary console applications and run
under ConPTY; Windows 10 1809 or later is required and Windows 11 is the baseline. Gemini
needs Node 20 or later (22 recommended). Known open issues: Codex TUI ANSI leaks and no
mouse scroll in some terminals; Gemini's Ink renderer reflows imperfectly on width changes.
No minimum terminal size is documented; the pane enforces a sensible minimum.

## R6. In-process tool service

**Decision**: Host `SwBridgeDispatcher` inside the add-in. Requests arrive on a pipe reader
thread and are marshalled to the SOLIDWORKS application thread with `Control.BeginInvoke`
on the pane control, serialized through the existing queue. The console `serve` command
stays for headless use. Rationale: the add-in already owns the `ISldWorks` pointer on the
application thread; a second STA worker would cross apartments on every call.

## R7. Chat transport

**Decision**: The add-in starts the Python backend (`swreview chat serve --port 0`) and reads
`{port, token}` from its first stdout line. The page calls loopback HTTP with the token in a
header; events stream over server-sent events. Rationale: single user, one direction of
streaming, trivially testable with an in-process HTTP client; WebSocket adds nothing here.

## R8. Secrets

**Decision**: Keys are stored with Windows DPAPI (`ProtectedData`, current-user scope) in
`%APPDATA%\SwReview\settings.json`; the add-in passes the key to the backend process through
its environment, never through arguments or files; logs redact any value that matches a
configured key. Rationale: FR-015 and the constitution's evidence rules.

## R9. Tool server for the CLIs

**Decision**: `swreview mcp` runs a stdio server with the `mcp` Python SDK exposing the
read-only subset (package query tools, measurement tools, `request_capture`, bridge capture
and measure). Names stay under 60 characters; the server name is `swreview`. Each call is
appended to `chat-log.jsonl` in the run folder. The check tools that create findings are not
exposed to general chat (FR-025).

## R10. Testing

- Python: adapter tests with `respx` for OpenAI and a stubbed client for Gemini; runner tests
  on `FakeProvider`; chat server tests with an in-process HTTP client; MCP server tests with
  the `mcp` client over in-memory streams; schema generation tests comparing the generated
  strict schema with the current contract per tool.
- C#: page-to-host message contract tests (JSON), ConPTY session tests against `cmd.exe`
  (echo, resize), in-process dispatcher tests with the existing fakes, settings encryption
  round trip.
- Manual: quickstart Scenario 7 on the workstation.

## Open questions carried as risks

1. Codex `mcp__server__tool` naming and the `enabled_tools` allowlist are documented only
   partially; verify on first launch by listing tools in the CLI.
2. Gemini policy engine precedence with `--approval-mode plan`; verify that a write is
   refused and an MCP call is allowed.
3. ConPTY inside a Task Pane hosted by SOLIDWORKS (message pump owned by SOLIDWORKS): verify
   input latency and resize behavior early.
4. OpenAI strict schema for tools whose parameters include `SourceRef` objects with nullable
   fields; the strictifier must produce a schema the API accepts (test with a recorded
   exchange).
